## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Preferred Method
1. Use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/ericsizemore/php-project-template/security/advisories/new) tab.
2. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability.
3. Include steps to reproduce (if possible).
4. Attach or describe any potential fixes you may have identified.

> When you submit through GitHub's Security Advisory system, a private advisory is automatically created where we can securely discuss and track the vulnerability.
> You'll maintain access to this advisory throughout the process and can communicate directly with me there.

### Alternative Methods
- For Tidelift subscribers: Use the [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).

### What to Expect
1. **Initial Response**: You'll receive an acknowledgment through the GitHub Security Advisory.
2. **Collaboration**: Through the private advisory, we will:
    - Confirm and validate the vulnerability
    - Discuss potential fixes or mitigations
    - Coordinate on the fix implementation
3. **Resolution**: Once a fix is ready, we will:
    - Prepare a new release with the fix
    - Publish the security advisory
    - Credit you as the reporter (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
    - Issue a CVE if appropriate

### Important Guidelines
- **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released.
- **DO NOT** open a public issue or pull request describing the vulnerability.
- If 90 days have passed since your report and no fix has been released, you may disclose the vulnerability publicly.

## Security Best Practices
- Keep your dependencies up to date.
- Always use the latest supported version.
- Enable security alerts in your GitHub repository settings.
